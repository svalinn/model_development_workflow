# Characteristics of a Canonical Geometry

__ _Canonical geometries should contain all aspects of the workflow so that
through the creation of the geometries one encounters all methods and
considerations necessary to create functional models._ __

### Basic Models

  * __Simple Model__
    - Show workflow in a model without complications.
    - Introduce issues arising from Cubit/Trelis.
    - Show basic functionality of Cubit/Trelis such as imprinting/merging, assigning materials, and meshing.

  * __Simple Model with Geometric issues__
    - Go through workflow with a model with geometric complications that are still easy to understand/visualize.
    - Show basic functionality of SpaceClaim by fixing geometric issues.
      * Overlaps
      * Unnecessary details to be removed
      * Small gaps
      * Curve coincident to surface

  * __Radial model__
    - Go through workflow with some applicability, could be a basis to build further complex models
    - Exemplifies curvilinear CAD issues
    - Introduces reflecting boundaries

### Auxiliary, Difficult Models (Further design considerations)

* MELCOR geometry (flows that split and recombine)
* Toroidal geometry with thin walls that may lose particles
* A radial slice where one encounters boundary conditions
* Implementation of reflecting boundaries
